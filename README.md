# Improving-Supply-Chain-Management-Using-Supervised-Regression

## Introduction

In the realm of Supply Chain Management, the efficient and seamless flow of goods and resources is pivotal. This project embarks on a journey to optimize this complex process through the power of Supervised Regression Analysis. Our dataset comprises crucial attributes such as warehouse details, geographical factors, and historical performance metrics. These parameters will be harnessed to develop and evaluate regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting, to predict and enhance various aspects of supply chain management. The project begins with data preprocessing and feature engineering, and then proceeds to model building, followed by in-depth exploration through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The objective is to uncover valuable insights, discover feature relationships, and ultimately, improve the overall efficiency of the supply chain.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on improving supply chain management using supervised regression analysis. It involves the following key steps:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning to handle missing values and irrelevant features.
- Feature engineering to create new variables and enhance the dataset.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights and understand the relationships between different features.
- Model building using various regression techniques such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting.
- Evaluation of the regression models to determine their effectiveness in predicting and improving supply chain efficiency.

## Data Exploration

Exploring the dataset to understand the characteristics of the data is a crucial step in the project. This includes examining data statistics, visualizing key features, and identifying correlations.

## Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is essential to ensure that the dataset is free from missing values and irrelevant information. This step involves handling null values, removing unnecessary columns, and preparing the data for analysis.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves creating new variables or transforming existing ones to enhance the dataset's predictive power. In this project, features like warehouse age, demand, supply, and demand interaction have been created to better understand the supply chain dynamics.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA is a critical step in the project as it helps uncover valuable insights and relationships within the data. This includes visualizing data, identifying trends, and understanding how different factors affect the supply chain.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves preparing the data for modeling by encoding categorical variables, normalizing data, and making it ready for regression analysis.

## Model Building

Regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting, are built and evaluated to predict and improve various aspects of supply chain management.

## Evaluation

The performance of the regression models is assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics. This step helps determine which model is the most effective in optimizing the supply chain.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project aims to enhance supply chain management through supervised regression analysis. By leveraging the power of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression modeling, we can uncover valuable insights and improve the efficiency of the supply chain. The project's findings and models will have practical applications in real-world supply chain optimization.
